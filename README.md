# VAM-Vendor-Architecture-Network
The VAM Vendor Architecture Network is a high language mainframe for integrating VHDL/HDL data into a 3D runtime environment. Compared to UML, it uses PHM Supervisors to maintain vendor interfaces (Semicom Suites) to collaborate with cloud based HDL prototyping and refactored semicom component rendering repositories.
