# VAM-Vendor-Architecture-Network
The VAM Vendor Architecture Network is a high language mainframe for integrating VHDL/HDL data into a 3D runtime environment. Compared to UML, it uses PHM Supervisors to maintain vendor interfaces (Semicom Suites) to collaborate with cloud based HDL prototyping and refactored semicom component rendering repositories.

SoC Maintenance Instruction Set

=Welcome to the VAM Labcoat wiki!=

Labcoat for SuperWikia Alpha fabrication manages new or revised VAM-Vendor-Architecture-Network fabrication processes. Its 'Cleanroom' applets allow codesmiths to access the SoC Maintenance Instruction Set lab environment, used to create semiconductors, substrate prototypes, chipset instruction blocks and other Labcoat projects. Our extensions in future releases will include UML support for C#/C++ conforming projects, import/export architecture schematics and refactoring sub-projects.

==Introduction to SoC Maintenance Instruction Set (SMIS) for VHDL and Labcoat-Cleanroom==

The core of all Labcoat operations is based upon the [[VHDL]] language, our intent is to provide toolsets and applications for our code community to work with VHDL to generate extensions to add to various techtrees within the Labcoat codebase.

The ''[[Labcoat-Cleanroom]]'' is a component of Labcoat which maintains what are known 'presets', function-based content which enhance or define chipset performance. Below is a list of supported presets:

**[[Substrate Presets]]- The components used to outline wafers
**[[Techtree Presets]]- The indexing components of the chipset. Outlines circuit paths
**[[Architecture Presets]]- The chipset model cache form factor
**[[Processor Presets]]- The command center of the chipset
**[[Lexicon Presets]]- The onboard logarithm database
**[[Entity Presets]]- The developer profile manager
**[[Schematic Presets]]- The mapping and data flow debugger

==Servelets and Architecture Maintenance==
Labcoat uses industry standards of ASIC based entities to make it's own â€˜servelets' to designate specific entities and architecture. These servelets increase the extensibility and preciseness of mounting chipsets and allow for prefab virtualization of all declarations.

==Excerpts and Appended Graphics for Labcoat==
Excerpting is a simplification process for building microarchitecture objects. It uses graphical illustrations versus coding to create virtual designs that can be used as a virtual semiconductor appliance. Appended Graphics are built upon the polygon object r
